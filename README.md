## Interview for Hotjar

I interviewed HÃ¥kon, a fellow classmate about how she experienced the website:

Can you describe your overall experience with the website's design?
The design is clean and easy to understand. I think the design is appealing and user-friendly. The layout was easy to navigate and the colors are aesthetically pleasing.

Were you able to find what you were looking for easily? Why or why not?
Yes, I was able to find what I was looking for easily. The navigation is simple and easy to understand.

Did the website's colors and overall visual design appeal to you? Why or why not?
Yes, I think the color scheme was consistent throughout the site and the design felt modern and up-to-date.

Were there any specific design elements that you found confusing or distracting?
I found some of the headers on the visit-page to be a little too small compared to the text-paragraphs.

## Report

1. Summary

We have been given a exam where we are to design and build a blog-website using Figma for design and HTML, CSS, and Javascript to build the site. The goal was to put in use what we have learned so far this first year and create a responsive website that works on both laptop and phone. This was a very exiting and difficult task. I feel that I got to challenge my skills and think of different solutions and ways to execute a problem. This year has been very exciting and filled with challenges and interesting subjects. This exam was a perfect way to show what I have learned this year!

2. Body

2.1. Introduction

The first thing I did was to decide what I would make a blog about. I chose to make a blog about marketing, and how to make your business expand and grow. Hence the name ExpandMedia. I wanted the website to have a business-focused design with a color scheme primarily consisting of shades of grey, orange, and white. It gave a professional and sophisticated look to the website in my opinion. The fonts used are clean and easy to read. I went with Kodchasan and SF Pro. SF Pro being the font Apple uses on their website and products. The layout I feel is well-organized, allowing users to navigate the website smoothly and explore blog posts without confusion. I used Chat-GPT to write my blogposts on Wordpress.

For the homepage we had to make a carousel to display the posts in. For the carousel I displayed the title and featured image for each posts. The code implemented pagination functionality, allowing users to navigate through different pages of blog posts using previous and next buttons, 4 at the time. Clicking on the posts sends you to the details page for each posts. This i feel enhanced the user experience by providing an organized and structured layout, encouraging visitors to explore and engage with the posts more effectively. I implemented the carousel on the blog details page as well to enhance the user experience.

Moving on to the Blog Post page. This code fetches and displays all the blog posts. It retrieves posts based on the selected sorting order and renders them on the page. Each post includes a featured image, title, excerpt, and a "Read More" button. The "Show More" button allows loading additional posts, and the sorting filter updates the displayed posts based on the selected order.

Then I moved on to my contact form. It initializes variables for each input field and sets up event listeners for validation. When the user submits the form, it prevents the default action and gets the values from the name, email, subject and message fields. The "validation" function checks if the input field meets specific requirements using regular expressions. If the input is valid, the "submitContactForm" function is called, which sends the form data to a server.

The last thing I did was to connect all the wireframes with interactive buttons on all the pages, so that you can navigate easily between the pages. I also made a hovering effect to make the website more alive and interactive. Lastly I deployed my website on Netlify and checked it on validator.w3.org and https://wave.webaim.org/ for any issues and problems. I made sure to consider WCAG principles when designing and coding the site. I tested this on Chrome using Lighthouse, and got a fairly high score on all the sites.

2.3. Conclusion
All in all i think this was a very challenging, but fun exam. You really get to challenge your creativity and skills. I feel much more confident in coding and have learned a lot from this exam. I am very happy with what I have learned this year, considering that I had no experience with any of the subjects we have had. I look forward to what next year has in store!

4. Acknowledgements

First I want to thank Monde Sineke for teaching me a lot of good techniques and ways to execute tasks and problems in our classes. It has given me a lot of inspiration. I also want to thank my classmates and the other teachers we have had this semester for help when I was stuck!

5. Appendices

I made a website from the Figma design which is interactive and responsive throughout all the pages. My goal was to make it as easy to use as possible, and to have a nice and cool design. I have explained the reasoning for my methods in the main section above.
